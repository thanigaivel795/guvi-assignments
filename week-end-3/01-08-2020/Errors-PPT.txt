Different types of error:-

Coercion error:-

	when we try to convert the data from one type to another either implicitly or explicitly this error may occurs.
	For eg:-if(0) - this 0 is equivalent to false which is of boolean type

Data type error:-
	Typically happens with the insufficient data value checking.

eg:- function sum(num1,num2){
	return sum1  + sum2
}
sum('hi',2)

Communication errors:-
	Invalid URL:-
		This error occurs when we are not hitting the actual URL. we should make sure we type the parameters correctly.
		we should use encodedURIComponent() to get rid of unwanted symbols typo.

	Response error:-
		Based on server response we may get error say server status 404 which is page not found.

	No network Connection:
		If we are not proper connection with the internet then we get an error
	
	

Throw our own error:-
	we should throw our own error based on the logic we right to understand where and why it is failing.

Try Catch :-
	In the application level we should be handling the errors to prevent the end of execution due to error.

Non-Fatal errors:-
	Non-Fatal errors do not interfere in users main task.Affects only a portion of page and recovery is possible

Fatal errors:-
	Fatal errors  interfere in users main task. Users cannot perform any tasks in the page 

Debug mode:-
	We should do debug to check our code is working without interruption. Try catch should re-throw the error and window.onError return false and we should allow
the browser to hndle errors.


Rule:
	Assume our code will fail
	Log errors to the server
	Programmer should handle the errors
	Identify where errors may occur
	Throw our own error
	Distinguish Fatal vs Non-Fatal errors
	Prvide Debug Mode
